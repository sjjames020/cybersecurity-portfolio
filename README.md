## üîç Projects & Labs
Each project includes a description, steps taken, outcome, and skills used.  

### [SQL Log Analysis: After-Hours Login Attempts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nXZuHCdwRNNbHf7VsFcP9h7ZU9eDzdYpXOUMgjl8G4/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Scenario:** Investigated potential unauthorized access after business hours.  
- **Steps Taken:** Queried login data with SQL, filtered for failed logins outside of 18:00‚Äì06:00, and validated suspicious activity.  
- **Outcome:** Identified patterns of repeated failed logins and documented findings in an incident-style report.  
- **Skills:** SQL, Log Analysis, Incident Reporting  

### [Linux Permissions Hardening](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NbwXyVAQH9ElOuip7iEDpB9xinKAzcZu3MgrYT9ppyo/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Scenario:** Practiced enforcing least privilege in a Linux environment to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Steps Taken:** Configured file permissions with `chmod` and `chown`, reviewed hidden directories, and interpreted 10-character permission strings.  
- **Outcome:** Secured sensitive files, removed risky default permissions, and created a repeatable process for checking vulnerabilities.  
- **Skills:** Linux CLI, File Permissions, System Hardening, Security Controls  

### [Vulnerability Scanning (TryHackMe)](https://sjjames020.github.io/cybersecurity-portfolio/openvas_portfolio.html)
What I Did:

- Deployed OpenVAS in Docker container on Ubuntu Linux
- Configured vulnerability scan targeting local network (127.0.0.1/172.17.0.1)
- Executed comprehensive scan - completed in 8 minutes, 27 seconds
- Identified 26 vulnerabilities including 1 critical CVSS 10.0 finding
- Analyzed critical flaw - default credentials (admin:admin) on management interface
- Generated professional reports with risk assessments and remediation guidance
- Documented complete workflow from setup to vulnerability analysis

Results:

26 total findings (1 Critical, 1 Medium, 24 Low)
Critical: Default credentials vulnerability allowing full system access
Services scanned: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS

Tools: OpenVAS, Docker, Ubuntu Linux
