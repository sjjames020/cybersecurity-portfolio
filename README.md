## üîç Projects & Labs
Each project includes a description, steps taken, outcome, and skills used.  

### [SQL Log Analysis: After-Hours Login Attempts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nXZuHCdwRNNbHf7VsFcP9h7ZU9eDzdYpXOUMgjl8G4/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Scenario:** Investigated potential unauthorized access after business hours.  
- **Steps Taken:** Queried login data with SQL, filtered for failed logins outside of 18:00‚Äì06:00, and validated suspicious activity.  
- **Outcome:** Identified patterns of repeated failed logins and documented findings in an incident-style report.  
- **Skills:** SQL, Log Analysis, Incident Reporting  

### [Linux Permissions Hardening](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NbwXyVAQH9ElOuip7iEDpB9xinKAzcZu3MgrYT9ppyo/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Scenario:** Practiced enforcing least privilege in a Linux environment to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Steps Taken:** Configured file permissions with `chmod` and `chown`, reviewed hidden directories, and interpreted 10-character permission strings.  
- **Outcome:** Secured sensitive files, removed risky default permissions, and created a repeatable process for checking vulnerabilities.  
- **Skills:** Linux CLI, File Permissions, System Hardening, Security Controls  

### [Vulnerability Scanning (TryHackMe)]()
- **Scenario:** Conducted a vulnerability scan to assess risks in a simulated network.  
- **Steps Taken:** Used Nmap to enumerate open ports and services, interpreted scanner results, and mapped findings to potential threats.  
- **Outcome:** Prioritized vulnerabilities based on likelihood and impact, demonstrating basic risk assessment workflow.  
- **Skills:** Nmap, Vulnerability Scanning, Networking Fundamentals, Risk Management
