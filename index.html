  <h1>👩🏽‍💻 Sonobia James (SJ)</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m SJ 👋🏽
I’m a computer science teacher who’s been slowly (but consistently) carving out my path into cybersecurity. I learn best by doing, so most of my work comes from hands-on labs, breaking things, fixing them, and trying again.
I am a curious and enthusiastic security professional with a strong commitment to ethics. I thrive on solving problems in the ever-evolving security landscape, staying calm under pressure while using thoughtful analysis to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and strengthen organizational resilience.</p>
Right now I’m working through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate while studying for Security+, building Python projects, and spending way too much time inside terminal windows. My goal is to pass Sec+ by March.

Some things I’ve been playing with lately:
• password-cracking labs using Hashcat
• experimenting with hashing + randomness (Fisher-Yates shuffle, etc.)
• Python tools like a phishing URL detector + password generator
• vulnerability scanning and basic SOC-style documentation
• trying to understand why attacks work, not just how to stop them

I’m interested in roles where I can keep learning, keep building, and apply all this in the real world, whether that’s in security operations, analysis, or something adjacent.

This is me learning out loud.
This is me being serious about my future.
Thanks for being here while I figure the rest out.</p>
